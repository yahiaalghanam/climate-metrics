# üåç Climate Metrics Analysis and Visualization

## Project Overview

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** that performs a comprehensive analysis of climate data, including statistical summaries, data visualization, and a discussion on simulating real-time data processing.

The primary goal of this project is to explore key climate variables (Temperature, Precipitation, Wind Speed) from a publicly available dataset, calculate essential metrics, and visualize their distributions and trends over time.

## üìä Dataset

The data for this project is sourced from a public dataset on **Kaggle**, which typically includes time-series records of various meteorological features.

* **Key Metrics Analyzed:**
    * `Temperature (Celsius)`
    * `Precipitation (mm)`
    * `Wind Speed (km/h)`
    * Other supporting meteorological data.

## ‚ú® Analysis and Key Findings

The notebook `climate_metrics.ipynb` executes several analytical steps:

### 1. Data Retrieval and Setup
The notebook is configured to use the **Kaggle API** to download the necessary dataset directly, ensuring a reproducible environment.

### 2. Statistical Metrics
Calculated and summarized key statistical metrics for the main climate variables:
* **Mean, Median, and Standard Deviation** for Temperature, Precipitation, and Wind Speed.

### 3. Visualization and Trends
* **Histograms** were generated to illustrate the distribution of Temperature and Precipitation.
* **Time Series Plots** were created to visualize the change and trends in Temperature and Precipitation over the dataset's time frame.

### 4. Real-Time Data Discussion
The notebook includes a discussion highlighting the limitations of a standard notebook environment for **true real-time data processing**. It lists the dedicated infrastructure and tools required for continuous monitoring and analysis of live climate data updates (e.g., Kafka, Flink, message queues).

## üíª Dependencies

To run this notebook locally, you need a Python environment with the following libraries:

```bash
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
plotly (or similar visualization library)
kaggle (for data download)
````

You can install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly kaggle
```

*(Note: You will also need to configure your Kaggle API credentials locally to download the data.)*

## üöÄ How to Run the Notebook

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repository-url]
    cd [your-repository-name]
    ```
2.  **Configure Kaggle API:** Ensure your `kaggle.json` file is set up correctly in your home directory for the notebook to download the data.
3.  **Launch Jupyter:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook climate_metrics.ipynb
    ```
4.  **Execute Cells:** Run all cells in the notebook sequentially to download the data, perform the analysis, and generate the plots.
